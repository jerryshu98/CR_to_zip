# Experiment Results 

This research focuses on analyzing regional characteristics of patients through Chest Radiographs (CR). The preprocessing stage is crucial, as it aims to ensure that the model captures physiological features associated with geographic locations rather than artifacts introduced during the image acquisition process. Below are some preprocessing recommendations designed to enhance the model's ability to learn patient-specific physiological traits effectively.
